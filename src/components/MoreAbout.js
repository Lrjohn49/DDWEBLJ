    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently attending Boise State University and am two semesters away 
      from receiving my bachelor's degree in computer science and an emphasis in 
      machine learning. I have been working at MDU Resources as a software developer
      intern since July 2022. While working there, I have gained practical 
      knowledge that I can't find at school. I have worked with Spring, spring boot,
      SQL, CI/CD, and Java development.
    </p>
    <p>
      At school, I have taken different machine learning and data science classes and 
      used Pytorch, Jupyter Notebooks, and TensorFlow when creating different models.
      My favorite class so far has been Natural Language Processing, where we learned
      how neural networks work and how to turn text and language into understanding
      for a model, and where I created a fine-tuned model of a preexisting model 
      called BERT for my final project to determine whether the text was suicidal,
      depressed, or neither to assist medical professionals.
